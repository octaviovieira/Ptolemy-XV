Reference ANSI C implementation (unoptimised)
=============================================

This floppy diskette (#1) contains the following files:

  Makefile
    rules for building and testing the C files

  serpent-api.h
    NIST API header file adapted for Serpent

  serpent-tables.h
    tables for S-boxes and linear transformation      
  serpent-reference.h
  serpent-reference.c
    serpent core implementation

  serpent-aux.h
  serpent-aux.c
    auxiliary functions that print and perform conversions

  serpent-test.c
    very basic command line test program


NIST-specified tests:

  ecb_vk.c
    variable key
  ecb_vt.c
    variable plaintext

  ecb_iv.c
    intermediate values

  ecb_tbl.c
    tables
  ecb_tbl_precomputed.txt
    Input data for tables test, as generated by the Java program
    Serpent.gen_plains (see floppy #3). The magic plaintexts are extracted
    from this file with grep and fed to the ecb_tbl test program. See the
    Makefile for more details.

  cbc_d_m.c
  cbc_e_m.c
  ecb_d_m.c
  ecb_e_m.c
    Monte Carlo (NB: with the above non-optimised reference code, these
    take several hours each to run)
